# Problem 0-2: Size of Data

Create either an infographic or visual representation of bit, byte, kilobyte, etc.

### Example

If a single bit were about the size of a single marble filled with water, how much water would a byte, kilobyte, etc. be?
* 1 bit -- a marble full of water
* 1 byte -- 1/8 cup of water
* 1 kilobyte -- 9 gallons of water
* 1 megabyte -- an above ground swimming pool full of water
* 1 gigabyte -- a football field sized-pool of water, three feet deep
* 1 terabyte -- a football field sized-pool of water, half a mile deep
